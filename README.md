# Comparative Analysis of ML Algorithms for Breast Cancer Diagnosis
## Lead Researcher: Elaheh Heidarian Gorji | Shahid Beheshti University

This research project explores the efficacy of supervised learning models in classifying breast cancer tumors. By utilizing the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, I have developed a computational framework to analyze 30 distinct features (e.g., mean radius, texture, and area) to optimize diagnostic accuracy.

## 🔬 Scientific Methodology
- **Pre-processing:** Implementation of feature scaling and normalization to handle variance in clinical measurements.
- **Dimensionality Assessment:** Evaluating the correlation between nuclear features and malignancy to select the most predictive biomarkers.
- **Model Comparison:** Benchmarking **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** against **Random Forest** to minimize false-negative rates in clinical predictions.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Successfully optimized the SVM classifier to achieve high sensitivity, ensuring that malignant cases are correctly identified.
- Identified that 'concavity' and 'perimeter' features are among the top predictors for tumor classification in this dataset.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Environment:** Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Data Science:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visual Analytics:** Seaborn heatmap for feature correlation analysis.
