Personal Observations on Model Performance:

During the experimentation, I found that the SVM model with a Polynomial kernel tended to overfit compared to the RBF kernel.

The feature 'mean concave points' showed the strongest correlation with malignancy.

Data normalization was a critical step; without it, the SVM model's convergence was significantly slower.
